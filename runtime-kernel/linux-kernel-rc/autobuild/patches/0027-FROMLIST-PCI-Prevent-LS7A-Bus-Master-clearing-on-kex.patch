Subject: [PATCH 027/301] FROMLIST: PCI: Prevent LS7A Bus Master clearing on
 kexec

This is similar to commit 62b6dee1b44a ("PCI/portdrv: Prevent LS7A Bus
Master clearing on shutdown"), which prevents LS7A Bus Master clearing
on kexec.

The key point of this is to work around the LS7A defect that clearing
PCI_COMMAND_MASTER prevents MMIO requests from going downstream, and
we may need to do that even after .shutdown(), e.g., to print console
messages. And in this case we rely on .shutdown() for the downstream
devices to disable interrupts and DMA.

Only skip Bus Master clearing on bridges because endpoint devices still
need it.
