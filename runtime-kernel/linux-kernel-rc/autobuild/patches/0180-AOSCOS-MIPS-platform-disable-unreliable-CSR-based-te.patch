Subject: [PATCH 180/301] AOSCOS: MIPS: platform: disable unreliable CSR-based
 temperature reading
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Disable CSR-based temperature reading, found only on Loongson 3A/B4000
processors. We found that on the Excelsior E23L (3B4000) boards, the
temperature reading would erratically pin to 239°C, triggering immediate
thermal shutdown.

We don't yet know about the true cause behind this issue, as both boards
we own are indeed using non-original heatsinks (but they can in fact
sustain >= 6 hours of stress testing with s-tui).

For now, disable this feature so that we can keep those systems working
and Loongson 3A/B4000 can still report their temperatures via the Chip
Temperature register (loongson_chiptemp).
