Subject: [PATCH 259/301] AOSCOS: staging: sb105x: replace deprecated strlcpy()
 with strscpy()

The string function strlcpy() was removed in commit d26270061ae6 ("string:
Remove strlcpy()") and per deprecated.rst:

  strlcpy() reads the entire source buffer first (since the return value
  is meant to match that of strlen()). This read may exceed the
  destination size limit. This is both inefficient and can lead to linear
  read overflows if a source string is not NUL-terminated. The safe
  replacement is strscpy(), though care must be given to any cases where
  the return value of strlcpy() is used, since strscpy() will return
  negative errno values when it truncates.

Replace calls to strlcpy() with strscpy().
