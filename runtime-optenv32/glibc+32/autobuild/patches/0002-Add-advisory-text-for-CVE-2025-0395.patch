+assert: Buffer overflow when printing assertion failure message
+
+When the assert() function fails, it does not allocate enough space for the
+assertion failure message string and size information, which may lead to a
+buffer overflow if the message string size aligns to page size.
+
+This bug can be triggered when an assertion in a program fails.  The assertion
+failure message typically includes, in addition to the invariant assertion
+string and function name, the name of the program.  If the name of the failing
+program is user controlled, for example on a local system, this could allow an
+attacker to control the assertion failure to trigger this buffer overflow.
+
+The only viable vector for exploitation of this bug is local, if a setuid
+program exists that has an existing bug that results in an assertion failure.
+No such program has been discovered at the time of publishing this advisory,
+but the presence of custom setuid programs, although strongly discouraged as a
+security practice, cannot be discounted.
