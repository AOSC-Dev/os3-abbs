# Excerpt from Fedora:
# This package uses top level ASM constructs which are incompatible with LTO.
# Top level ASMs are often used to implement symbol versioning.  gcc-10
# introduces a new mechanism for symbol versioning which works with LTO.
# Converting packages to use that mechanism instead of toplevel ASMs is
# recommended.
